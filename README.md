Folder for (most of) my Java submissions in CIS 125 at DMACC (Intro to Programming) during summer 2025. Not interested in grabbing the Coral items. I think I have shown I know what variables, arrays, loops, etc are. 
I believe all of these files are properly cleaned with the renaming I did. I might have missed one or two, but it's not that important if I did. They're almost all very simple.
In particular, check out my final. M14FourRooms. Not the most riveting RPG ever made, but it was fun to throw together.
